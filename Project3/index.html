      <h2>Why plant trees <br>in urban areas?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Trees are an important part of any environment. They absorb harmful greenhouse gas emissions, which are much higher in highly populated cities. Along with this, they also provide shade and block wind, which can drastically improve urban life quality. Shade prevents solar heat from hitting concrete sidewalks, which in turn helps to lower the urban Heat Island Effect. They can help with noise pollution as well as stormwater mitigation, when their canopies are full. Trees and urban forests also provide habitats for the animals that live in cities, like birds, squirrels, and insects. It is important that both animals and humans have nature around them, especially in a city.

      <h2>Suitable Seeds</h2>
      <p>
        Certain trees thrive best in certain environments. An urban landscape is a harsh environment for a tree, so a good sidewalk tree must be sturdy and resilient. It must be able to adapt to a wide range of soils, tolerate things like drought and shade, and resist pests and diseases. Examples of trees that are suitable for urban planting are American Elm, Ginkgo, Field Maple, American Red Oak, and London Plane.
